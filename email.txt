The files I created for all 4 of your assignments are at
https://github.com/stevesiegel/ibmprices.

Note that for the moving average png file I had trouble figuring out
how to format the x axis with dates.

I would appreciate it if you could look at my Python
script and suggest how to add the x-axis dates, as well as legend
showing the name of each curve associated with each color.

Thanks.

Dear Student,

I am not very skilled at enhancing x-axis and legend.

I did, however, enhance your work a little:

https://github.com/danbikle/ibmprices/blob/master/dan_ibm_prices3.py

My general approach to plotting time-series is to sort and load the dates into a DF column.

I like that to be the first column.

I then see that column as almost ready for giving me x-values.

Next I will fill the 2nd column with data for the y-axis.

And I will fill the 3rd,4th,5th columns with data if I want more than 1 line.

In this case I want a line for price and a line for mvg avg.

After I fill col-2 with price and col-3 with mvg avg, I return my attention to col-1 full of date-strings.

I use a comprehension to convert each string to a date:

date_dt_l = [datetime.strptime(day_s, '%Y-%m-%d') for day_s in prices3_df.date_s]

Then I add the resulting List to the DF as a col-4.

Now I dont need col-1 ; I want to delete it.

I do this by creating a new DF from col-2,col-3,col-4.

During that creation I reorder the columns so col-4 is col-1.

Next I convert col-1 to an index.

Now I have a DF with two columns (price, and price_ma) and that DF has index full of sorted dates.

Now I can do this:

my_df.plot.line(title="My Plot")

Then Pandas teams up with matplotlib to give me an okay-plot.

I noticed that you did not try to combine Pandas with matplotlib.

You did this instead:

plt.plot(ibm_price,'r',ibm_price_ma,'b')

I see that as 'pure matplotlib, no Pandas'.

That is an okay path to take if you want to learn all the ins-outs of matplotlib.

I've tried doing that in the past and it can get difficult and tedious.

Sincerely, Dan Bikle
